The Difference between CLI and GUI is the way they interact with users. When looking at CLI also known as command-line interface allows for users to interact with computer programs through a series of lines of text. GUI also known as graphical user interface allows users to interact with computer programs with graphical icons. The main difference I have noticed between the two is how they visually look towards users. The way users interact towards CLI is by text commands, while GUI allows users to interact by clicking on icons. GLI seems to be a more visual interaction while the CLI is more hands on and uses text.
